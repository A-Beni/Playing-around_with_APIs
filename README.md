# Playing-around_with_APIs

This repository is based on a reflection of the past API course. I have applied the knowledge that I acquired in my web-building studies to provide a solution to the task that we have been assigned. The project inside this repository is a currency converter app. This app lets users easily convert their base currencies to quote currencies they want. I chose this project because my love for forex analysis inspires it. Moreover, ALU students have difficulty converting the currencies from their home countries to the R.W.F.

This project is mainly HTML, CSS, and plain Vanilla JavaScript. This is because it is a reflection of what we covered this year. I have also used APIs to fetch some currency rates.

I would like to add that this project will continue to be developed, and I will make sure to make it more efficient.
Have a good time using this app. Note that I have modified some of the API code from rapidapi.com to match my needs for this project.
